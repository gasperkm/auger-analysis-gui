1. Installation:

Pre-requisites:
A newer (5.34 or higher, support for version 6 not added yet) pro version of ROOT (https://root.cern.ch).

Installation is done through the usual "./configure" and "make" commands.

Configure takes the following arguments:
- First argument is the configure option (help, nomake, all, lib, clean, compress):
    help = shows configure help
    nomake = configure installation but do not run make
    lib = same as nomake, but compile libraries afterwards with make
    all = same as nomake, but compile the program afterwards with make
    clean = cleans the installation to the base file structure (keeps the results directory)
    compress = compresses the base installation into a tar-ball
- The following arguments set specific computer details and can be entered in any order:
    a) --root-install=/path/to/root/directory -> The ROOT install directory, if it is not installed in a standard location (especially needed when running the program with superuser, since it usually does not have the required environment variables).

Running "./configure" or "./configure help" will give more information on specific uses.
Example:
   ./configure all --root-install=/opt/root

Makefile:
Once configuration is done, a Makefile will be generated and further installation is done by running "make". Running "make library" will only recreate the libraries in case something has been edited in them.
Example:
   make
